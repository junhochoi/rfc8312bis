      "body": "As discussed in [this tcpm thread](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tcpm/O7Q55oXcoI1XNBZ_wAQOMdhRQNY/), after fast convergence (section 4.6), the candidate target value of the congestion window may be less than the current congestion window. For example, say cwnd = 100, beta_cubic = .7 and a congestion event occurs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nW_max = cwnd = 100;\r\nW_max = W_max*(1.0+beta_cubic)/2.0 = 85   // further reduce W_max for fast convergence\r\n\r\ncwnd = cwnd * beta_cubic = 70\t          // window reduction\r\nW_cubic(0) = W_max * beta_cubic = 59.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we were to enter congestion avoidance at this point, with a small enough RTT, the candidate target congestion window as calculated by W_cubic(t+RTT) may be less than the current congestion window (~59.5 < 70). \r\n\r\nThe suggestion in the thread from Lisong Xu and Vidhi Goel is to change Equation 2 to:\r\n```\r\nK = cubic_root((W_max - cwnd)/C) (Eq. 2)\r\n```\r\nwhere cwnd is the congestion window size at the beginning of the current congestion avoidance. This will ensure the target is greater than the current congestion window, and in my opinion is a more clear representation of what K represents.",

RFC assumes that cwnd is set to W_max * beta_cubic in fast recovery and remains as W_max * beta_cubic at the beginning of a congestion avoidance stage. However, the behavior of Linux TCP in/around fast recovery is complicated, such as adjusting cwnd based on the number of packets in flight, and adjusting cwnd in case of undo. As a result, at the beginning of a congestion avoidance stage, cwnd may or may not be W_max * beta_cubic, and sometimes may be even higher than W_max. \r\n\r\nI guess this RFC does not need to follow the fast recovery of Linux TCP, but it is safer to add that else condition. \r\n\r\nThanks",

After that, I will submit a PR.\r\n\r\n## RFC 8312\r\n\r\n- It changed the definition of beta_cubic constant and thus updated the pseudocode of CUBIC accordingly. For example, beta_cubic in the original paper was the window decrease constant while RFC8312 changed it to CUBIC multiplication decrease factor. With this change, the current congestion window size after a loss event is beta_cubic * W_max while it was (1-beta_cubic) * W_max in the original paper.\r\n- It included the discussion on safety features of CUBIC, such as CUBIC's fairness in small and high bandwidth-delay product (BDP) networks and the recommended CUBIC constant C.\r\n\r\n## Original paper\r\n\r\n- The original paper included the pseudocode of CUBIC implementation using Linux's pluggable congestion control framework, which excludes system-specific optimizations. The simplified pseudocode might be a good source to start with and understand CUBIC.\r\n- It also includes experimental results showing its performance and fairness.",

K formula has changed in the RFC, to cbrt ((W_max - cwnd)/C) whereas in the paper it is cbrt((W_max * Beta)/C) where Beta = 1-cubic_beta\r\n2. TCP friendly window is called W_est in the RFC whereas it is W_tcp in the paper (subtle difference). Also, we added a note to change alpha_aimd to 1 when W_est > W_max\r\n3. Fast Convergence section - Although Section 3.7 describes the fast convergence using W_max and W_last_max (which is same as the RFC), the corresponding pseudocode in Algorithm 1 only uses W_last_max (as W_max) and it seems a bit incorrect. Not sure what we add regarding this.",

RFC 8511 proposes that senders should back off less in response to a CE-mark (note, this is in the world of ECT(0) ) than to a packet loss, because the CE-mark not only indicates congestion - it also indicates the presence of an AQM algorithm, which probably keeps the queue relatively short.\r\n\r\nWe found this to be generally beneficial, some details here:  https://folk.universitetetioslo.no/michawe/research/publications/Networking2017ABE.pdf\r\nand recommend a value of 0.85 for cubic_beta in the RFC, for whoever wants to participate in this experiment.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that Cubic should now change its backoff factor for good, but the experiment should probably be cited as such, and the reference updated - and if one of you implementers would like to try out a value greater than 0.8, such as 0.85 or 0.8, that would of course be extra cool!",

However, this targe size may be too high, like even higher than 2 * cwnd (i.e., more aggressive than slow start), in the following special cases.\r\n\r\n   * case 1: RTT is extremely long. An extremely long RTT is very likely an indication of network congestion, in such an environment it is dangerous to set a very high target. \r\n\r\n  * case 2: after a long idle period (i.e., a big increase of t). This is a [bug reported and fixed by Google](http://bitsup.blogspot.com/2015/09/).\r\n\r\n  * case 3: after a long application rate-limited period (i.e., a bug increase of t). Similar to case 2\r\n\r\nTo be safer, we may change Equation (1) as follow to fix all the above bugs\r\n\r\n```\r\n    W_cubic(t) = C*(t-K)^3 + origin_point (Eq. 1)\r\n    if (W_cubic (t) > 2* cwnd)\r\n        W_cubic(t)  =  2 * cwnd\r\n```\r\nNote that, Linux Cubic already does something similar ([line 328](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.c#L328)) by limiting target to be no more then 1.5 * cwnd.\r\n\r\nThanks",

Consequentially the slope (inverse of\n    ca->cnt) would be really large, and eventually ca->cnt would be\n    lower-bounded in the end to 2 to have delayed-ACK slow-start behavior.\n\n    This particularly shows up when slow_start_after_idle is disabled\n    as a dangerous cwnd inflation (1.5 x RTT) after few seconds of idle\n    time.\n\n    Jana initial fix was to reset epoch_start if app limited,\n    but Neal pointed out it would ask the CUBIC algorithm to recalculate the\n    curve so that we again start growing steeply upward from where cwnd is\n    now (as CUBIC does just after a loss). Ideally we'd want the cwnd growth\n    curve to be the same shape, just shifted later in time by the amount of\n    the idle period.\n\n    Reported-by: Jana Iyengar <jri@google.com>\n    Signed-off-by: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>\n    Signed-off-by: Yuchung Cheng <ycheng@google.com>\n    Signed-off-by: Neal Cardwell <ncardwell@google.com>\n    Cc: Stephen Hemminger <stephen@networkplumber.org>\n    Cc: Sangtae Ha <sangtae.ha@gmail.com>\n    Cc: Lawrence Brakmo <lawrence@brakmo.org>\n    Signed-off-by: David S.

Is that the intent?\r\n\r\nThe Linux TCP CUBIC implementation has already always bounded the rate of increase of the cwnd to at most 1.5x per round trip time. Initially it did this implicitly (the logic only allowed cwnd increases on at most every alternate ACK), and then when the stretch ACKs fixes were put in place the bound became explicit. See:\r\n  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.c?id=d578e18ce93f5d33a7120fd57c453e22a4c0fc37\r\n\r\nGiven that separate pre-existing bound of 1.5x per round trip, AFAICT the proposed fix of bounding to less than 2x per round trip would be NOP, AFAICT? Or perhaps I misunderstand the proposal.\r\n\r\nBy the way, for YouTube we found this implicit bound of 1.5x per round trip was important for keeping losses at a reasonable level. This has a large impact on behavior, and presumably big implications for fairness between CUBIC implementations. So this may be important to document in the RFC, if it is not already (I couldn't find it, but I may have just missed it).\r\n",

The basic problem is that any detected packet loss causes the host to reduce the window and start a new epoch. In some environments we can see spurious loss detection, caused for example by delayed ACKs or out of order delivery. These spurious losses can be easily identified in QUIC, and with some extra work in TCP. It would be useful if the revised RFC has a section on handling spurious losses.\r\n\r\nThe handling that I did implement was simple: reset the epoch parameters to the value of the previous epoch, before the loss.

W_last_max should be initialized to 0.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there is a confusing difference between RFC and Linux code: RFC has two variables, W_last_max and W_max, whereas Linux code has only W_last_max that corresponds to W_max in RFC. This is confusing, so I would recommend removing W_last_max from the RFC, as it is used only in Section 4.6. \r\n\r\nHow about changing paragraphs 2, 3, 4 of Section 4.6 as follows?\r\n\r\n_With fast convergence, when a congestion event occurs, we update W_max as follows before the window reduction described in Section 4.5._\r\n\r\n```\r\n      if (cwnd < W_max){                        // should we make room for others\r\n          W_max = W_max*(1.0+beta_cubic)/2.0;   // further reduce W_max\r\n      } else {\r\n          W_max = cwnd                          // remember cwnd before reduction\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n_At a congestion event, if the current cwnd is less than W_max, this indicates that the saturation point experienced by this flow is getting reduced because of the change in available bandwidth.  Then we allow this flow to release more bandwidth by reducing W_max further.  This action effectively lengthens the time for this flow to increase its congestion window because the reduced W_max forces the flow to have the plateau earlier.  This allows more time for the new flow to catch up to its congestion window size._\r\n\r\nThen remove the following line from Section 4.5, because W_max is set in Section 4.6 now.\r\n\r\n```\r\nW_max = cwnd;                 // save window size before reduction\r\n```\r\n",

One thing to note though, earlier we were saving W_last_max = W_max (before applying fast convergence) and now we won't have that state saved. Instead we would always compare with W_max after fast convergence is applied.\r\n",

My main implementation issue was understanding the dimensions of each formula.\r\n\r\nTwo important points from the bis draft:\r\n\r\n1. Forget about the TCP friendly formula.

All of these have been addressed. \r\n\r\n> My notes on implementing Cubic for QUIC are at https://huitema.wordpress.com/2019/11/11/implementing-cubic-congestion-control-in-quic/. I already provided feedback to the \"bis\" RFC. Yes, porting Cubic to QUIC is fairly straightforward. My main implementation issue was understanding the dimensions of each formula.\r\n\r\nThis is fixed with the new section [Definitions](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-eggert-tcpm-rfc8312bis-02#section-4.1)\r\n> \r\n> Two important points from the bis draft:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Forget about the TCP friendly formula. It does not work well, because RTT jitter will translate in CWIN swings. It is much simpler to just run the RENO algorithm in parallel and set the CWIN to max(Reno, Cubic)\r\n\r\nAIMD friendly formula now is based on RENO - [Section 4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-eggert-tcpm-rfc8312bis-02#section-4.3)\r\n\r\n> 2. You really want to implement the recovery from spurious losses discussed in the bis draft. I think this is actually the reason for the drop in perf in face of reordering mentioned in the EPIC paper \"Making QUIC Quicker With QUIC Offload\". Not the CPU cost of reordering.\r\n\r\nIIRC, this was the issue you had filed and we add a new section [Spurious Congestion Events](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-eggert-tcpm-rfc8312bis-02#section-4.9)\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "@goelvidhi yes, I appreciate that the issues have been addressed in the new draft. This is good. @larseggert was asking whether there was something specific to say about Cubic for QUIC. The main remaining issue is about translating the windows counts from \"packets\" to \"bytes\". When I ported Cubic to QUIC, I spent some time doing that. I first rewrote the Cubic formula:\r\n```\r\n                                             3\r\n                      W     (t) = C * (t - K)  + W\r\n                       cubic                      max\r\n```\r\nIn a \"neutral\" way:\r\n```\r\n                                                    3\r\n                                        /    /t - K\\     \\\r\n                      W     (t) = W  * (C' *( ----- )  + 1)\r\n                       cubic       max  \\    \\  K  /     /\r\n```\r\nThis rewrite helped me understand what was going on. We have a windows size coefficient, `Wmax`, expressed in the same unit as CWIN; a coefficient C' that is a pure scalar and defines the `aggressiveness` of the implementation; and a cubic curve that is a function of `(t-K)/K`. The same rewrite helps understand the coefficient C -- or C' in the new notation.\r\n```\r\n                            C     3\r\n                      C' = --- * K\r\n                            W\r\n                             max\r\n```\r\nWhich reduces to:\r\n```\r\n                                   / W    - W    \\\r\n                            C     /   max    start\\     \r\n                      C' = --- * ( ----------------)\r\n                            W     \\       C       /\r\n                             max\r\n\r\n                             / W    - W    \\\r\n                            /   max    start\\     \r\n                      C' = ( ----------------)\r\n                            \\       W       /\r\n                             \\       max   /\r\n```\r\nIn most cases, when `sstresh` is larger than 2 packets, this reduces further:\r\n```\r\n                      W      = \u03b2 W\r\n                       start      max\r\n\r\n                      C' = (1 - \u03b2)\r\n\r\n                                                         3\r\n                                        /         /t - K\\     \\\r\n                      W     (t) = W  * ((1 - \u03b2) *( ----- )  + 1)\r\n                       cubic       max  \\         \\  K  /     /\r\n```\r\nThe formula does not depend on the unit of W, packet or bytes. The coefficient C disappears, but of course it is key in computing the pseudo-period `K` of the cubic curve.",

In these cases, it makes sense to restore the previous values of all the variables (better performance and safe). \r\n\r\nSecond (unusual cases), an undo happens long after a spurious loss event, and as a result, the current cwnd at undo is already higher than prior_cwnd. In these cases, it makes sense to keep the current values of all the variables, because their prior values were measured and calculated too long ago and thus may not be good or accurate measurements of the current network condition (bandwidth, delay, ...)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the undo code is\r\n~~~\r\n    if (cwnd < prior_cwnd) {\r\n        cwnd = prior_cwnd\r\n        ssthresh = prior_ssthresh\r\n        W_max = prior_W_max\r\n        K = prior_K\r\n        epoch_start = prior_epoch_start\r\n        W_est = prior_W_est\r\n    }\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nHow do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

How about we define a new variable cwnd_{start} for just figure/equation 2 as we have discussed before?\r\n\r\nThat is, we change figure/equation 2 as follows, and replace all cwnd in the paragraph immediately below figure/equation 2 with cwnd_{start}.\r\n\r\nK = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{W_{max} - cwnd_{start}}{C}}\r\n\r\nUpdate other sections accordingly as follow\r\n\r\nIn Section \"Variables of interest\", we add \"cwnd_{start}: The cwnd at the beginning of the current congestion avoidance stage (i.e., at time epoch_{start})\"\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
